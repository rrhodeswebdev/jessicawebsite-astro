                        Hi, my name is Camilla Alexander. I have been a licensed
                        cosmetologist in North Carolina since March 2013. In
                        addition to my license, I have specialized training in
                        balayage, color formulations, and sculpting curly hair
                        textures.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-light mb-4">
                        While I love working on all hair types and styles, I
                        specialize in vibrant reds, creative colors and color
                        corrections. I also enjoy educating clients on their
                        hair type to help them achieve their style goals.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-light mb-4">
                        When Iâ€™m not behind the chair, you will find me spending
                        most of my time with my family. I am a wife to my
                        wonderful husband, Mason, and a mother to my beautiful
                        son, Aidan. I am also a fur mother to two crazy cats,
                        Lela and Loki. When I have time to myself, I love
                        watching crime shows, enjoying coffee dates with close
                        friends, and traveling to the beach.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-light mb-4">
                        In addition to my years of experience and expertise, I
                        am passionate about helping each person who sits in my
                        chair love themselves, inside and out. Whether you
                        prefer a silent appointment to unwind and relax, or you
                        need someone to share your cares with, I want every
                        client to walk away from my chair expressing their true
                        personality on the outside, and feeling better than when
                        they arrived!
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-light mb-4">
